- The performance test indicates that query speed over a single connection is half that of the
  normal Oracle connector. Need to check if this is really the case in a production environment.
  If so need to determine if its a problem in django-oraclepool or if it relates to the different 
  features of a cx_Oracle pooled connection. 

- Oracle 11g has internal session pooling - DRCP - and cx_Oracle can use that for
  even better performance, so need to add appropriate modification to test whether 
  the database 11g or later, and use this feature in place of a cx_Oracle side pool.
  NB: requires cx_Oracle 5, see http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/tuininga-cx_oracle.html
