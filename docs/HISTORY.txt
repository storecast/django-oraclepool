Changelog
=========

0.3 - Initial release (2010-01-28)
----------------------------------

- Added test suite including performance test to demonstrate benefits
- Tested and made compatible with django 1.2 (as well as django 1.1)
- Cleaned up the code and factored out anything that wasnt specific to pooling,
  subclassing most components from the standard Oracle engine.
- Modified logging options so DEBUG switches on log to screen and EXTRAS['log'] 
  switches logging to file option separately.

0.2 - Used for UoB student reps
-------------------------------

- Commented out debug print statements from DatabaseWrapper._cursor which broke install in wsgi
- Added DatabaseWrapper.__init__ like the oracle backend with client, creation and introspection
  borrowed from it, since creation is expected in django 1.1.1 code.
- Added default value of None for settings in DatabaseWrapper._cursor since this argument is not 
  expected in django 1.1.1 code.
- Added DATABASE_EXTRAS dictionary to set all the session parameters from django config.
- Added session pool settings report method, to check these.
