0.7 - Oracle LIKEC performance work around and bug fixes (2010-09-20)

  [Ed Crewe]

----------------------------------------------------------------

- Use django 1.2 database settings format by default
- Fix a bug with adding sql log to page when in DEBUG

- Drop homogeneous extra argument since unecessary and breaks if used with earlier cx_Oracle
- Fix tests for earlier cx_Oracle
- Remove unused separate class declaration for pools
- Make sure all tests pass
- Ensure default settings are picked up when using old format settings with 1.2 [Marc Bee]

- Wrap connection signal in try except for older django compatibility.

  [Ed Crewe]

0.4 - Fix performance test (2010-01-29)
---------------------------------------

- Whoops, I realised the performance test was underplaying the improvement due to a bug,
  it now gives the same performance for single connections (as expected) and 300% 
  improvement for multiple ones.
- Added signal for connection 'creation' and fixed raise of unicode error

  [Ed Crewe]

0.3 - Initial release (2010-01-28)
----------------------------------

- Added test suite including performance test to demonstrate benefits
- Tested and made compatible with django 1.2 (as well as django 1.1)
- Cleaned up the code and factored out anything that wasnt specific to pooling,
  subclassing most components from the standard Oracle engine.
- Modified logging options so DEBUG switches on log to screen and EXTRAS['log'] 
  switches logging to file option separately.

  [Ed Crewe]

0.2 - Used for UoB student reps
-------------------------------

- Commented out debug print statements from DatabaseWrapper._cursor which broke install in wsgi
- Added DatabaseWrapper.__init__ like the oracle backend with client, creation and introspection
  borrowed from it, since creation is expected in django 1.1.1 code.
- Added default value of None for settings in DatabaseWrapper._cursor since this argument is not 
  expected in django 1.1.1 code.
- Added DATABASE_EXTRAS dictionary to set all the session parameters from django config.
- Added session pool settings report method, to check these.
- Added python logger option and sql_log middleware
